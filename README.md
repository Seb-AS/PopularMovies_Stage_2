# Popular Movies - Stage 2

Android app to help users find recent and popular movies.


## Instructions

To fetch data from TMDb it is needed that you put your API Key in the project.

If you don't have one you need to create an account (it's free) and request a key by logging in to your account on TMDb and clicking the "API" link in the left hand side bar of your account page.

Then you need to go to `ApiClient.java` in PopularMovies_Stage_2/app/src/main/java/com/popularmovies/network` package file and replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder at the top of the file with your api key.
